        # 1 Hashtag are Comemnts/Analogies and Explanations
        ## 2 Hashtags are runable code, delete the hashtags to run the code/add or change the code for practice

        # NOTE To run the code delete 2 ## hastags at the start of every line this will uncomment them. below will tell you how using shortcuts:


        # 1. Highlight all the code with 2 ##
        # 2. Once highlight use shortcuts to uncomment to run the code:

                        # macOS: Cmd + /                # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##
                        # Windows/Linux: Ctrl + /       # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##
        
        # 3. Run the code to see the results in the terminal

        # Assuming you are using Vscode and you are using this file, you should see a play button on top right corner 
        # The outcome will appear in the terminal 
        # Option 2 is to run the file from the terminal this is done by typing
                                            
                # python3     then the name of the file, in this case it will be LearnPython.py
                # so in my case to run this file the command will be.
                                                        
                        # macOS:                python3 LearnPython.py
                        # Windows/Linux:        python LearnPython.py

        # Open A Terminal Using Keyboard Shortcuts
                # 1. Using Keyboard Shortcuts
                # Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + (Backtick)
                # macOS: Press Cmd + (Backtick)
                # The backtick key () is usually located just above the Tab` key.

                # 2. Using the Top Menu
                # Go to the top menu bar:
                # Windows/Linux: View > Terminal
                # macOS: View > Terminal
                # This will open the integrated terminal at the bottom of your VSCode window.

        # NOTE Once you run the code and moving on to the next section put the comment ## back this will comment them again.
                        
        # 4. Highlight all the code you uncommented 
        # 5. Once highlight use shortcuts to omment to run the code:

                        # Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Z       # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##
                        # macOS: Cmd + Z                # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##


        # Alternatively, you can delete and type them back individually as you do in a text document.

# ========================================================= 1. COMMUNICATION PRINT() ===================================================================
# ======================================================================================================================================================      


""" GOAL OF THIS SECTION """
# Learn how to use the print() function to display messages on the screen.
# Understand how to modify what the computer "says."


""" EXPLANATION """
# Analogy:
# The print() function is like the computer's mouth. When you use print(), 
# Whatever is inside the parentheses () is "spoken out loud" (displayed) by the computer. It's how the computer communicates with you.


""" RUNABLE CODE """
## print ("Hello world")


""" EXPECTED RESULT """

# When you run the code, the computer will display: 
                        
                        # Hello world 


""" TASK """
# Try it yourself:

# Modify the code to make the computer say "I Love Coding".
# Run it and see the result!


""" ENCOURAGEMENT """
# Once you’ve mastered this, can you make the computer say multiple things? For example, 
# try adding another print() line to display: Learning Python is fun! 🚀✨


"""KEY CONCEPT SUMMARY"""
# The print() function is used to display messages to the user.
# You can use it multiple times to "say" different things.
# Whatever text is inside print() (surrounded by quotes) will appear on the screen.

# Next, you’ll learn how to store information using variables—stay tuned! 😊

# ========================================================= 2. VARIABLES  ==============================================================================
# ======================================================================================================================================================


""" GOAL OF THIS SECTION """
# Learn how to use variables to store and manipulate data.
# Understand how to perform basic arithmetic with variables.


"""EXPLANATION"""
# Variables - Your Storage Boxes
# In Python, variables are like labeled storage boxes where you can keep information.

# Analogy:
# Imagine you’re organizing a shelf:
# 	•	You label one box “Apples” and put 10 apples inside.
# 	•	Another box is labeled “Bananas” with 5 bananas.
            
                        # apples = 10
                        # bananas = 5

# Now the computer knows:
# 	•	apples holds 10.
# 	•	bananas holds 5.
# You can ask it to add them by using the print():


"""RUNABLE CODE"""
## apples = 10
## bananas = 5
## print (apples + bananas)



""" EXPECTED RESULT """
# Result will be : 15


"""TASK"""
# Try it yourself:

# Add more fruits! What if you had 8 oranges, 3 pineapples, and 7 avocados?
# Write the code to calculate the total number of fruits you have.
# Run it and see the result! 🚀✨


""" ENCOURAGEMENT """
# Analogy:
# Think of your shelf getting bigger with more labeled boxes (variables). 
# You can add as many as you want, and the computer will do the math for you.

# Can you also try subtracting or multiplying the number of fruits? For example:
# print(apples * 2)  # Doubling the number of apples


""" KEY CONCEPT SUMMARY """
# Variables store data like numbers, words, or other information.
# You can use arithmetic operators like +, -, *, and / to manipulate variable values.
# Variables let the computer remember information for you to use later.

# Up next, we’ll explore the different types of information that variables can store. Stay tuned! 😊

# ====================================================================================================================================================== 


""" GOAL OF THIS SECTION """
# Learn about different data types in Python: int, str, float, and bool.
# Understand how to store and print values of different types.


"""EXPLANATION"""
# Not all boxes store the same type of thing! Python has different kinds of storage boxes:

# 	•	int: Numbers (like 5 or 10) → Think: A box for counting items.
# 	•	str: Text/Strings (like “Hello”) → Think: A box for letters or words.
# 	•	float: Decimal numbers (like 3.14) → Think: A box for precise measurements.
# 	•	bool: True/False → Think: A yes/no box.

# Create your own variables:
# How old are you? (int)
# What’s your favorite color? (str)
# How much did you spend on lunch today? (float)
# Are you excited to learn Python? (bool)
# Print each variable and see what happens! 🚀✨


""" ENCOURAGEMENT """
# Analogy:
# Think of yourself as the organizer of a shelf with lots of different boxes. 
# You can store any kind of information in these boxes—numbers, words, or even yes/no answers.

# Can you also try combining the variables in creative ways? For example:

#print("Hi " + name + ", the price of your coffee is $" + str(price))

#This is a great way to practice mixing data types! Let’s see what you can come up with! 😊


""" KEY CONCEPT SUMMARY """
# Data types define the kind of information a variable can store.
# Common types:
# int for whole numbers.
# str for text.
# float for decimal numbers.
# bool for True/False values.
# You can use variables of different types together in creative ways.
# Up next, we’ll explore how to interact with users by asking them questions using the input() function. Stay tuned! 😊


# NOTE we will chat about these later. now lets have a look at input() fanction and what it does

# ======================================================================================================================================================
# ================================================== 4. INPUT() - LISTENNING TO YOU ====================================================================
# ======================================================================================================================================================


"""EXPLANATION"""                                        
# The input() function is how you make the computer "ask questions." It works like this:

# Analogy:
# The computer is like a waiter asking, "whats your name" and “What do you want to order?”


# Analogy Part2
# Remember our variable analogy? Previously, we put values into boxes (variables) ourselves. 
# Now, with the input() function, someone else (the user) gets to decide what goes into those boxes.
# Instead of you manually putting in the data, you're asking the user, and their response becomes the content stored in the variable.

# The input is what the user types. For example, if the waiter (computer) asks, "What's your name?" and you type Will, that's your input,
# and the computer stores it in a variable (like a box).

# We are asking the computer to do 3 things 

                        # 1. Asks for the user's name.   
                        # 2. Takes the user's answer and stores it in a variable called name.
                        # 3. Prints a message that says "Hello," followed by the name, and adds "!" at the end.   


""" RUNABLE CODE """
## name = input("What's your name? ") # here we are telling the compueter to ask for your name
## print("Hello, " + name + "!") # here we are taking the results of the name adding Hello before the name and printing both Hello + name + "!"

# In this case, name is the variable where the value returned by the input() function (the user’s input) is stored.


""" EXPECTED RESULT """

# When you run the code, the computer will display:
#  
                        # What's your name? Will  
                        # Hello, Will!


# NOTE (WILL IS MY INPUT AS AN ANSWER TO THE QUESTION)

""" TASK """
# Try it yourself:

# Change the variable name from name to surname.
# Modify the message to include Mr (or Ms) before the name


""" ENCOURAGEMENT """
# Can you figure out what happens if you use both name and surname variables? 
# Try combining them to create a full greeting, like 'Hello, Mr Will Smith!' 🚀✨

# ================================================= 4.1 INPUT PART 2 ADDING MENU =======================================================================
# ====================================================================================================================================================== 


"""GOAL OF THIS SECTION"""
# Combine what we’ve learned so far to build a simple restaurant menu.
# Understand the difference between int and str in the menu context.


"""EXPLANATION"""  
# Lets build on what we have learned so far and add a menu 
                        
                        # 1. we want to welcome the user and ask for their name 
                        # 2. Once we have the users name we want to say Hello + Name + Give them the Menu 
                        # 3. Display the menu 
                        # 4. Take the users order via an input 
                        # 5. confirm the order by displaying a (messege + name + message + order + message) 

# In these functions we will be using (int) and (str)  

# So far we know how to Welocme users and ask for their name 

                        # name = input("Welcome to Python Diner! What's your name? ")
                        #                       str                     str

# But how would we show them a menu?
# The first part is the same as we done before we just add it to the print function
# We will add more text to the last str that will diplay "Here's our menu"

# NOTE we didn't add a new string(str) we added more text to the existing (str)  "!"

                        # print("Hello, " + name + "! Here's our menu:")

# Great we now  did a few cool things: 

                        # We welcomed the used
                        # We asked for thier Name
                        # We got their name 
                        # We said Hello (using their name)
                        # and we verbally gave them a menu

# But no menu is visible, so how do we create a menu they can see and intract with?

# To do this we use the print() function again 

                        # print("""
                        # Menu:

# Next we need to give the customer a way to put in their order so we can make for them, the customer has 3 as display on th menu
# The customer needs to have a way to input their choice, to do this we need to create another input() function 

# it will look like this:

                        # order = input("What would you like to order? (Type the name of the dish) ")


# order: This is a variable that stores the value returned by the input() function. The user is prompted to type something, 
# whatever they type is stored in the order variable.

# Great we now  did a few cool things: 

                        # We welcomed the used
                        # We asked for thier Name
                        # We got their name 
                        # We said Hello (using their name)
                        # We verbally gave them a menu
                        # We displayed a menu with options 
                        # and we are able to take the order

# I think one last line code to Confirm the order will do.abs

# lets create the final line of code to confirn the order by using the print() function again
# This time, we will use the print() function to display the input() function variables 
# alongside strings to create a friendly message that confirms the customer's order.

# it will look like this

                        # print("Great choice, " + name + "! We'll prepare your " + order + " right away.") 
                        #             str          str             str                int          str

# Analogy:
# Imagine you’re at a restaurant. Instead of choosing a dish by its number (e.g., "1" for Pizza), you simply say the name of the dish (e.g., "Pizza").

# Did you try it? if you did you would of noticed its still fuctioning as if your item is there even though its not . right?
# lets make our program even cooler by handle such errors.

""" GOAL OF THIS SECTION """
# Learn how to handle situations where the user enters invalid input.
# Introduce basic error handling techniques to guide users back to correct choices.
# Continue building the restaurant menu by adding input validation.


""" EXPLANATION """
# Input Validation: LOOPS - Guiding the Customer

# Analogy:
# Imagine you're a waiter at a diner. If a customer orders something not on the menu, you politely ask them to choose again. 
# You keep asking until they pick something available. This is how loops work in programming—they keep repeating a task until a certain condition is met.



# What is a Loop?
# A loop is a way to tell the computer to do something repeatedly as long as a specific condition is true.
# while loop: Think of it as a question that keeps asking, "Is this still true?" If the answer is "yes," it keeps running. Once the answer is "no," it stops.

# How Does a While Loop Work?
# It checks a condition.
# If the condition is true, it runs the block of code inside the loop.
# Once the condition becomes false, it stops.

# Loop Analogy:
# Imagine you’re giving directions to a customer who keeps making wrong turns. You say: "Keep going until you see the big red building."
# They continue moving in the loop until the condition ("seeing the red building") is met.

# How Does This Apply to Input Validation?
# When the customer enters an invalid order:
# We politely tell them their choice is unavailable.
# The program repeats the question until they select something valid.
# Once they choose correctly, the loop stops.

# we do this by added an extra step before confirming the order, it will look like this
                        # Step 4: Validate the order using a loop
                        # while order not in menu:  # This loop will run until the user enters a valid menu item
                        #     print("Sorry, we don't have that item. Please choose something from the menu.")
