        # 1 Hashtag are Comemnts/Analogies and Explanations
        ## 2 Hashtags are runable code, delete the hashtags to run the code/add or change the code for practice

        # NOTE To run the code below delete 2 ## hastags at the start of every line this will uncomment them. below will tell you how using shortcut:


        # 1. Highlight all the code with 2 ##
        # 2. Once highlight use shortcuts to uncomment to run the code:

                        # macOS: Cmd + /                # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##
                        # Windows/Linux: Ctrl + /       # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##
        
        # 3. Run the code to see the results in the terminal

        # Assuming you are using Vscode and you are using this file, you should see a play button on top right corner 
        # The outcome will appear in the terminal 
        # Option 2 is to run the file from the terminal this is done by typing
                                            
                # python3     then the name of the file, in this case it will be LearnPython.py
                # so in my case to run this file the command will be.
                                                        
                        # macOS:                python3 LearnPython.py
                        # Windows/Linux:        python LearnPython.py

        # Open A Terminal Using Keyboard Shortcuts
                # 1. Using Keyboard Shortcuts
                # Windows/Linux: Press Ctrl + (Backtick)
                # macOS: Press Cmd + (Backtick)
                # The backtick key () is usually located just above the Tab` key.

                # 2. Using the Top Menu
                # Go to the top menu bar:
                # Windows/Linux: View > Terminal
                # macOS: View > Terminal
                # This will open the integrated terminal at the bottom of your VSCode window.

        # NOTE Once you run the code and moving on to the next section put the comment ## back this will comment them again.
                        
        # 4. Highlight all the code you uncommented 
        # 5. Once highlight use shortcuts to omment to run the code:

                        # Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Z       # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##
                        # macOS: Cmd + Z                # Do this 2 times as there is 2 ##

""" EXPLANATION """
# Analogy:
# The print() function is like the computer's mouth. When you use print(), 
# whatever is inside the parentheses () is "spoken out loud" (displayed) by the computer. It's how the computer communicates with you.

# Try it yourself:

# Modify the code to make the computer say "I Love Coding".

"""EXPLANATION"""
# Variables - Your Storage Boxes
# In Python, variables are like labeled storage boxes where you can keep information.

# Analogy:
# Imagine you‚Äôre organizing a shelf:
# 	‚Ä¢	You label one box ‚ÄúApples‚Äù and put 10 apples inside.
# 	‚Ä¢	Another box is labeled ‚ÄúBananas‚Äù with 5 bananas.

# Now the computer knows:

# You can ask it to add them by using the print():

# Add more fruits! What if you had 8 oranges, 3 pineapples, and 7 avocados?
# Write the code to calculate the total number of fruits you have.
# Run it and see the result! üöÄ‚ú®


""" ENCOURAGEMENT """
# Analogy:
# Think of your shelf getting bigger with more labeled boxes (variables). 
# You can add as many as you want, and the computer will do the math for you.

# Can you also try subtracting or multiplying the number of fruits? For example:
# print(apples * 2)  # Doubling the number of apples

# Not all boxes store the same type of thing! Python has different kinds of storage boxes:

# The input() function is how you make the computer "ask questions." It works like this:

# Analogy:
# The computer is like a waiter asking, "whats your name" and ‚ÄúWhat do you want to order?‚Äù


# Analogy Part2
# Remember our variable analogy? Previously, we put values into boxes (variables) ourselves. 
# Now, with the input() function, someone else (the user) gets to decide what goes into those boxes.
# Instead of you manually putting in the data, you're asking the user, and their response becomes the content stored in the variable.

# The input is what the user types. For example, if the waiter (computer) asks, "What's your name?" and you type Will, that's your input,
# and the computer stores it in a variable (like a box).

# We are asking the computer to do 3 things 

                        # 1. Asks for the user's name.   
                        # 2. Takes the user's answer and stores it in a variable called name.

# But how would we show them a menu?
# The first part is the same as we done before we just add it to the print function
# We will add more text to the last str that will diplay "Here's our menu"

                        # and we verbally gave them a menu

# But no menu is visible, so how do we create a menu they can see and intract with?

# To do this we use the print() function again 

                        # print("""

                        # The name of the food options are only visible to the user.

# Great our code so far should look like this:

                        # Step 1:  welcome the customer and Ask for the customer's name
                        # name = input("Welcome to Python Diner! What's your name? ") 

                        # #Step 2: Greet the customer with their name collected for the previous input() and display "Here's our menu"

# Next we need to give the customer a way to put in their order so we can make for them, the customer has 3 as display on th menu
# The customer needs to have a way to input their choice, to do this we need to create another input() function 

# it will look like this:

                        # order = input("What would you like to order? (Type the name of the dish) ")


# order: This is a variable that stores the value returned by the input() function. The user is prompted to type something, 
# whatever they type is stored in the order variable.

# I think one last line code to Confirm the order will do.abs

# lets create the final line of code to confirn the order by using the print() function again
# This time, we will use the print() function to display the input() function variables 
# alongside strings to create a friendly message that confirms the customer's order.

# it will look like this

                        # print("Great choice, " + name + "! We'll prepare your " + order + " right away.")
